TimeKeeper - a Forge mod
=============

TimeKeeper Mod for Minecraft 1.6.2

This mod will sync the Minecraft time to the time outside. Keep in mind sunsets probably won't be perfectly synced, because minecraft sunsets don't vary based on seasons or location. However, the game will be running on a 24 hour cycle, and keep in sync, meaning you can sleep through night. In your bed.

##Installation

1. Install forge (http://files.minecraftforge.net). This mod was last tested and built with 9.10.0.804.

2. Put the downloaded zip into minecraft/mods (where minecraft is your minecraft folder). You can find information on locating your minecraft folder here: http://hopper.minecraft.net/help/finding-minecraft-data-folder/


##To get started in a new world, you have two options:

With NEI:

1. Turn on cheat mode

2. Find the "Time Keeper" block, give it to yourself, and place it in the world.

Without NEI:

1. If your world doesn't have cheats enabled, open it to LAN with cheats on.

2. Type /gamemode @p 1

3. Go to the redstone tab, and give yourself one Time Keeper. Place it in the world.

It has no recipe, and you only need one per world. However the chunk needs to stay loaded, so placing it spawn is helpful.

You shouldn't need to do anything else. If you notice the mod is causing significant server load, create an issue in github, and I will look into it :) (https://github.com/ezfe/TimeKeeper/issues)
